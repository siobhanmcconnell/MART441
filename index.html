                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p><p>My name is Siobhan. I'm a Media Arts Major. I like digital art, but I'm not very good at it yet. I'm excited to learn more this semester! I'm taking MART 341 concurrently with this class, so some of the "review" is completely new to me (which may be evident by how close this page resembles the example.) I've enjoyed my progress at UM so far, and I'm looking forward to growing even more this semester. Hopefully that includes growing as a coder!

                            <h1>Game Memory</h1>
                            <p>My game memory is the first time I played a game online with a friend. When I was younger, I almost always played local multiplayer games. My parents were the ones to buy and pick out video games, so it makes sense that they would buy ones that my sister and I could specifically play together. I had one friend at school who also played video games, and it turned out we both had exactly one game in common, and luckily, it was one of the few online games we both had. However, whenever we decided to play it, we would go to each others house and play together locally anyways. One day, I couldn't leave the house, so we decided to play online and talk over the phone. By the time we were done, I had sworn it had only been an hour or so, but I looked at the timer on the phone, and it had actually been 4 or 5, and the phone was completely dead.</p>

                            <h2>Additional Section</h2>

                            <p>An issue I think games could help solve is accessibility to education. Not everyone has the same opportunities available, but as time goes one, more and more people have access to computers, the internet, etc. I think games could easily be used for certain kinds of work training. If someone needs to learn how to use possibly dangerous machinery, they could practice in VR before using the real thing. Maybe in the future, if there aren't any convenient schools nearby, a student could log in to a virtual classroom. I had all sorts of educational games and devices when I was younger, and I'm constantly surprised that there's not more for the current generation of kids.

AI reflection:

A big difference between my version and the AI version was that the AI did everything through the pop-up window instead of textboxes on the page. It was also a lot shorter again. It made one question with five choices rather than five questions (which may be an indicator that I need to figure out how to re-word the prompt). One thing I did like about it was it assigned a number to each of the choices and had the user input the number. I think that probably would've been a better way to do my project since several questions had multiple or long words answers which were sensitive to spelling, capitalizations, spaces, etc. I was hoping to see inspiration for good ways to incorporate the loop requirement, but it looked like that part of the AI version didn't work since it didn't let the user actually access the page itself.
